**Analyzing 1000 Data Science Books on Amazon**

To explore a little bit about what kind of data science books are available out there, i found a data set on kaggle that contained data on nearly 1000 data science books on Amazon, including the ratings, the price, the number of pages and other characteristics.

In this project i will be doing two levels of analysis-what i would call basic and intermediate.

On level 1, i will do some simple exploratory data analysis to answer questions like do more expensive books have better reviews? Is it always true that longer books are more expensive? What are the best python related books and what are the best machine learning books based on review stars?

Moving on to level 2, i start getting a bit more fancy. i want to find out what are the main types or main categories of data science books out there based on the book titles. I will be using k-means for clustering the book titles and in order to do that for text data, i use an NLP technique called TFIDF or term frequency inverse document frequency to convert the text into numeric features.
